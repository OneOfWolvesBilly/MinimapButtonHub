## 🙌 Credits

MinimapButtonHub is an original AddOn developed entirely from scratch.  
It was inspired by **MinimapButtonBag Reborn** (last updated 2024/09/14, version 11.0.2),  
which became incompatible with modern versions of World of Warcraft.  

This project does not reuse any code or structure from MinimapButtonBag or any other project.  
It is a fully independent implementation designed for WoW Dragonflight and beyond.
